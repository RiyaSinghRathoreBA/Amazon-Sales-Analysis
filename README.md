- Standardizing formats (e.g., dates, currency).

### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed an initial analysis to understand the dataset, identify outliers, and gain high-level insights using descriptive statistics and visuals.

### Step 5: Data Transformation
Transformed the data for analysis by:
- Creating new calculated columns (e.g., total amount, units sold, total sale, review).
- Aggregating data by city and state, product category, and time periods.

### Step 6: Define KPIs
Selected key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
- Total Sale
- Total Revenue
- Units Sold
- Revenue per product
- Customer Review
- Returned or Lost items

### Step 7: Dashboard Design
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with the following pages:
- **Overview:** Key metrics and trends by Sales and Units based on different Product category.
- **Products:** Insights into top-performing products and categories.

### Step 10: Documentation and Presentation
Documented findings, methodology, and recommendations in:
- PowerPoint presentation.
- README file for portfolio and sharing.
- GitHub repository with dashboard file and detailed explanation.
